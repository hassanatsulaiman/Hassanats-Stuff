<h3>Reading</h3>
<img src="images13/books.png" alt="">
<p>My favorite books are realistic fiction.I am trying to get out of my comfort zone by reading mystery books.In fifth grade my teacher told me <br>
  that I was not reading books on my level which meant I wasnt challenging myself with my reading so I had to stop reading on level books which was <br>
  hard for me.
